           <strong> The Significance of January 26</strong> <br><br>
            The date, 26th January, was chosen for Republic Day to commemorate the declaration of Purna Swaraj (Complete Independence) in 1930 by the Indian National Congress.

            After almost 2 years, 11 months, and 18 days, the Constitution was finalized and adopted on 26th November 1949.
            However, it was officially enforced on 26th January 1950 to honor the anniversary of the Purna Swaraj resolution.
